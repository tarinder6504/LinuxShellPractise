Given two integers,  X and  Y, identify whether X < Y or X > Y or X = Y .

Exactly one of the following lines:
- X is less than Y
- X is greater than Y
- X is equal to Y 

Solution:-

read X
read Y
if (( $X > $Y )); then
    printf "X is greater than Y"
elif (( $X == $Y )); then
    printf "X is equal to Y"
else
    printf "X is less than Y"
